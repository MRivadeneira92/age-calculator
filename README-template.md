## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The year is in the future
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: See the age numbers animate to their final number when the form is submitted

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
This proyect help me in learning how to display information clearly and making it appealing by using simple animations. When I put together the proyect layout I wanted a simple counting up animation when displaying the result of the calculated date. This was achieved by first storing the target value in a variable, setting a second variable vith value 0 and adding one to this variable until it reaches the same number as target value. 

I wanted to make a simple function that could animate any digit just by giving it a value and where it has to display the animation. The code is as follows: 

```js
  function animateDigit(value, position) {
    let timeAnimation = 60;
    let counter = 0; 
    if (value > 50) {
      timeAnimation = 30;
    }
    let i = setInterval(function() {
      if (counter == value) {
        clearInterval(i);
        document.getElementById("result-" + position).classList.add("ani-up");
        setTimeout(function(){
          document.getElementById("result-" + position).classList.remove("ani-up");
        },3000)
      }
      document.getElementById("result-" + position).innerHTML = counter;
      counter++;
    }, timeAnimation)
  }
```

The core of the function is inside setInterval. By using the same naming conventions on the id of the tags storing the resulting values, this function can find where the animation has to go with the input stored in "position". 
Inside the function there is an animation. It triggers when the target number has been reached and it is a simple bump to signal when that calculation is done.

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

My main objective moving fowards is learning how to make better animations. I want to me able to create an odometer-like animation for the numbers.
